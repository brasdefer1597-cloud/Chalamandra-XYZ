🦎 Chalamandra QuantumMind XYZ
The Chrome extension that brings the power of Dialectical AI to your browser.

Chalamandra QuantumMind XYZ isn't just a tool; it's a thinking partner that enhances human clarity through structured processes of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

🚀 Key Features
Our extension integrates a hybrid multimodal approach, combining the speed of local AI with the power of the cloud.

Feature	Description	Base Technology
Contextual Analysis	Direct injection into the web page to read selected text and analyze the context.	content_scripts.js
Triple Personality	Three distinct AI voices (CHOLA, MALANDRA, FRESA) debate simultaneously to offer a 360° view.	DialecticalOrchestrator.js
Quantum Collapse	Internal process that resolves the tension between thesis and antithesis to produce an actionable and aligned synthesis.	QuantumCollapse.js
Local-First (Privacy)	Instant, private, and offline analysis powered by Gemini Nano.	background.js / Gemini Nano
🧠 The Personality Matrix
The heart of Chalamandra is its dialectical system, where each personality brings a unique perspective:

CHOLA (Thesis - The Core of Wisdom): Provides foundational knowledge, patterns, and history. What has worked before?

MALANDRA (Antithesis - The Engine of Disruption): Challenges assumptions, identifies risks, and proposes chaotic alternatives. What are the hidden flaws?

FRESA (Synthesis - The Optimal Orchestrator): Combines elements from CHOLA and MALANDRA to refine the message and make it immediately actionable. What is the clearest and most impactful path?
