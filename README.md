# 🦎 Chalamandra QuantumMind XYZ

**The Chrome extension that brings the power of Dialectical AI to your browser.**

Chalamandra QuantumMind XYZ isn't just a tool; it's a thinking partner that enhances human clarity through structured processes of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

## 🚀 Key Features

Our extension integrates a **hybrid multimodal** approach, combining the speed of local AI with the power of the cloud.

| Feature | Description | Base Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contextual Analysis** | Direct injection into the web page to read selected text and analyze the context. | `content_scripts.js` |
| **Triple Personality** | Three distinct AI voices (CHOLA, MALANDRA, FRESA) debate simultaneously to offer a 360° view. | `DialecticalOrchestrator.js` |
| **Quantum Collapse** | Internal process that resolves the tension between thesis and antithesis to produce an actionable and aligned synthesis. | `QuantumCollapse.js` |
| **Local-First (Privacy)** | Instant, private, and *offline* analysis powered by Gemini Nano. | `background.js` / Gemini Nano |

## 🧠 The Personality Matrix

The heart of Chalamandra is its dialectical system, where each personality brings a unique perspective:

1.  **CHOLA (Thesis - The Core of Wisdom):** Provides foundational knowledge, patterns, and history. *What has worked before?*
2.  **MALANDRA (Antithesis - The Engine of Disruption):** Challenges assumptions, identifies risks, and proposes chaotic alternatives. *What are the hidden flaws?*
3.  **FRESA (Synthesis - The Optimal Orchestrator):** Combines elements from CHOLA and MALANDRA to refine the message and make it immediately actionable. *What is the clearest and most impactful path?*
